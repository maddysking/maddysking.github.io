<b><p font size=100px style="color:#990000">Top 5 Weirdest Facts About the Ransom Note</p></b>
<ol style="color:#9E9E9E">
    <li> The ransom amount, $118,000, was the same amount as John Ramsey’s Christmas bonus. </li>
    <li> The ransom note was written on a pad found in the Ramsey’s home and written with a pen from their home. Rough drafts of the note were found in the trash can. </li>
    <li> Patsy Ramsey could never be ruled out as the author of the ransom note. After analyzing five different samples, she was still deemed inconclusive by various analysts. </li>
    <li> Linguistically, the ransom note is very odd. It seems staged and remnisent of a movie. </li>
    <li> The length of the ransom note was very long and would have likely taken the author more than 30 minutes to write. This is an alarming fact considering whoever wrote the note did so inside the home. </li></ol>
<b><p font-size=100px style="color:#990000">Things that stick out</p> </b>
  <ul style="color:#9E9E9E">
    <li>The author spelt business incorrectly as “bussiness” but then used terms like attache that support intelligence.</li>
    <li>The ransom amount of $118,000 is pretty low in relation to the risk of being involved in a kidnapping and the fact that the Ramsey’s were very wealthy.</li>
    <li>The note clearly explains that contacting anyone would result in their daughter’s death, yet they immediately called the police and neglected to mention the importance of discretion. </li>
    <li>Referring to them as a “small foreign faction” seems counterproductive in eliciting fear over the parents. </li>
    <li>The author seems like they don’t personally know John Ramsey at the beginning, but then seem to lean towards familiarity toward the middle and end of the letter. </li></ul>
